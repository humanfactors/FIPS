# Fatigue Impairment Prediction Suite (FIPS)

<img align="right" src="https://github.com/humanfactors/FIPS/blob/master/inst/logo/FIPS_logo.png?raw=true" alt="FIPSLOGO" width="200"/> 

> If you are measure sleep behaviour or want to predict fatigue, this package probably can help.

FIPS is an R package that provides researchers and practitioners with a comprehensive set of functions for applying and simulating from bio-mathematical models (BMMs) of fatigue.

FIPS includes a set of functions for transforming sleep and actigraphy data to the data frame structure required for executing BMM simulations (called a [`FIPS_df`](https://humanfactors.github.io/FIPS/reference/FIPS_df.html)). Importantly, FIPS includes a set of functions for simulating from and interpreting several forms of BMM, including the [Unified Model](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022519313001811) and [Three Process Model](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0108679). All models are extendable and include customisable parameters. The core features of FIPS leverage R's flexible `S3` class system, making extensions straightforward.

## Installation
We have no plans for a CRAN submission. To install the latest version of FIPS:

```r
# install.packages('remotes') # if remotes not installed
remotes::install_github("humanfactors/FIPS")
```

# Core Features Example

Detailed information regarding the FIPS data formats can be found in the ["FIPS Simulation Walkthrough Vignette"](https://humanfactors.github.io/FIPS/articles/FIPS-simulation-walkthrough.html).

If you require a more manual user-interface to generate the FIPS-df, we have a web application that may help you generate the input CSV: https://github.com/Akhil-Eaga/FIPS-Data-Entry-System.


**Step 1:** Prior to simulation, FIPS requires sleep history data to be in a special format, called a [`FIPS_df`](https://humanfactors.github.io/FIPS/reference/FIPS_df.html) which contains all the information required for modelling (e.g., time awake, time asleep). This can be created with [`parse_sleepwake_sequence`](https://humanfactors.github.io/FIPS/reference/parse_sleepwake_sequence.html) or [`parse_sleeptimes`](https://humanfactors.github.io/FIPS/reference/parse_sleeptimes.html).

```r
my_FIPS_dataframe = FIPS::parse_sleepwake_sequence(
  seq = unit_sequence,  # A binary (1,0) vector 
  epoch = 5,            # Epoch in minutes of vector
  series.start = as.POSIXct("2020-05-21 08:00:00"))
```

**Step 2:** To run a model simulation, you use [`FIPS_simulate`](https://humanfactors.github.io/FIPS/reference/FIPS_simulate.html), which returns a `FIPS_simulation` with all model predictions/forecasts generated in the corresponding columns. Note that the formula argument is optional, and sensible defaults will be used if omitted.

```r
# Run a simulation with the three process model
TPM.simulation.results = FIPS::FIPS_simulate(
  FIPS_df = my_FIPS_dataframe,   # A FIPS_df
  modeltype = "TPM",             # Three Process Model
  pvec = TPM_make_pvec()         # Default parameter vector
  # formula = alertness ~ s + c + u + w  # An optional formula for output
)

# Run a simulation with the unified model
unified.simulation.results = FIPS::FIPS_simulate(
FIPS_df = my_FIPS_dataframe,   # A FIPS_df
modeltype = "unified",         # Unified model
pvec = unified_make_pvec()     # Default parameter vector
)  
```

```

**Step 3:** You now can access printing, summary and plot methods for the FIPS_simulation object. A [detailed tutorial of the plotting functionality](https://humanfactors.github.io/FIPS/articles/plotting.html) for FIPS is provided in the vignettes.

```r
plot(TPM.simulation.results)
summary(TPM.simulation.results)
print(TPM.simulation.results)
```

## What are BMMs?

BMMs are a class of biological phenomenological models which are used to predict the neuro-behavioural outcomes of fatigue (e.g., alertness, performance) using sleep-wake history. There are several different BMM implementations, but most have their roots in Borbély's (1982) two process model which stipulates that sleepiness/performance impairment functions in response to two processes: a circadian process and a homeostatic process. BMMs enable hypothesis testing of the latent factors underlying the relationships between sleep, fatigue, and human performance. For example, they enable researchers to estimate the relative contributions of homeostatic processes on fatigue, relative to endogenous circadian processes. These models are also frequently applied by defence and industrial sectors to support system safety as part of broader fatigue management strategies. FIPS is the first open-source BMM framework enabling practitioners to inspect, validate, and ideally extend BMMs. 

## Critical Model Information

Critical functions, arguments and outputs for each model are summarised in table below:

| Model                        | Three Process           | Unified                      |
|------------------------------|-------------------------|------------------------------|
| `FIPS_Simulate` argument     | `"TPM"`                 | `"unified"`                  |
| Parameter vector function    | `TPM_make_pvec()`       | `unified_make_pvec`          |
| Default formula              | `alertness ~ s + c + u` | `fatigue ~ s + I(κappa) * c` |
| Time varying parameter names | s, c, u, w              | s, l, c, w                   |
| Default prediction outputs   | KSS, alertness          | Fatigue (PVT lapses)         |

## Human Risk Index Implementation
The FIPS package is in the process of integrating a novel model, the Human Risk Index (HRI), which is currently under pre-alpha testing. This model, developed on the foundation of earlier work by Folkard and Lombardi (2004), Folkard et al. (2006, 2007), and others, offers an estimation of the relative risk of safety incidents tied to different work schedules (Fischer et al., 2017). The HRI improves upon the original Risk Index model by incorporating an hourly detail level, enhancing both its predictive accuracy and application range for risk evaluation and accident analysis (UK Rail Safety and Standards Board, 2015).

While the HRI's implementation is in progress, it is not yet automated to the same standard as other models within FIPS. However, the development team is actively working to optimize and integrate the HRI fully.

The HRI pre-alpha implementation can be found on the [`HRI-implementation` branch](https://github.com/humanfactors/FIPS/blob/HRI-implementation) The files under the `R` directory are under active development. A working implementation of the code can be found in https://github.com/humanfactors/FIPS/blob/HRI-implementation/notes/HRI.R in the `HRI-implementation` branch.

# Contributing and Support

We welcome contributions great or small from the community. It would incredibly useful to receive feedback via Github Issues for anything regarding the package, including: installation issues, bugs or unexpected behaviour, usability, feature requests or inquiries, or even something you don't understand in the tutorials about this class of models more generally. Please file a Github issue for any general support queries too.
