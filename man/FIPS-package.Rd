\title{FIPS: The Fatigue Impairment Prediction Suite}
\description{
The "Fatigue Impairment Prediction Suite" (FIPS) is currently under development and implemented in the R programming language.
FIPS provides researchers and practitioners comprehensive set of functions for applying bio-mathematical models (BMMs) of fatigue.
FIPS is under active development and implemented in the R programming language.
FIPS provides a set of well-documented functions for transforming sleep and actigraphy data to formats required for applying BMMs,
as well as a set of functions for simulating and interpreting BMMs with several kinds of models and customisable parameter settings.

\details{
BMMs are a class of biological phenomenological models which are used to predict the neuro-behavioural
outcomes of fatigue (e.g., alertness, performance) using sleep-wake history.
These models are frequently applied by defence and industrial sectors to support system
safety as part of broader fatigue management strategies.
FIPS is the first open-source BMM framework enabling practitioners to inspect, validate, and ideally extend BMMs.
Although there are several different implementations of BMMs, most have their roots in Borb√©ly's (1982)
 two process model which models sleepiness/performance impairment as the sum of two processes: a circadian process and a homeostatic process.
